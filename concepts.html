      <h2 class="subheading">abstraverse</h2>
      <p>A digital art house that resides onchain. Abstraverse was the first concept I imagined when I understood what decentralized blockchains could offer.</p>
      <p>A multi-year project that started in 2021, the current goal is to get 1000 fine art pieces onchain on the same contract. After that, we have some plans that would seem too ambitious currently.</p>

      <h2 class="subheading">hyperspeeed</h2>
      <p>A conceptual visual art album put onchain as a debut for the lght.eth wallet. Hyperspeeed was an experiment in retrofitting musical album themes for digital art.</p>
      <p>The album is a story about pursuing enlightenment and the harrowing journey of self-discovery and expression.</p>

      <h2 class="subheading">/imagine:</h2>
      <p>The controversy of ai in art is understandable, but personally it holds little value in my mind-sphere. Ai is cool to me, and raw ai art poses so many possibilities.</p>
      <p>/imagine: is an erc1155 collection of raw ai art 'posters'. It is an experiment that tracks the aesthetic progression and ability of these new art algorithms in real time.</p>

      <h2 class="subheading">memeware</h2>
      <p>Software, but for the mind. Any interweb enjoyoor understands the concept of memes in comical context.</p>
      <p>The idea of memeware could be best crystallized with Jack Butcher's Visualize Value graphics. As a former student of his, memeware is a project in translating my own existential interests into digestible parts.</p>

      <img src="Images/worms.png" alt="Image 5">
      <h2 class="subheading">gummy worms</h2>
      <p>The third installment in AV's onchain progression. Gummy Worms is a generative art collection that mixes 90s nostalgia, javascript, & inspiration from the infamous 'Chromie Squiggles' Art Blocks project.</p>
      <p>A curated collection of 50 outputs, bringing a three dimensional candy-like playfulness to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

      <img src="Images/stream.png" alt="Image 6">
      <h2 class="subheading">streaming ai</h2>
      <p>Streaming AI is a 50 piece collection that plays with introverted personalities of all shapes and sizes, human or other. It embraces the quirky environment it is birthed in (onchain culture).</p>
      <p>A departure from convential practices, streaming ai is an ai-collaborative experiment in algorithmic congruence and the aesthetic meshing of past and present.</p>
