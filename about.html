    <p>Originally lured here by promises of perpetual royalties for my creative work; something I had never dreamt of in the near decade of traditional art I practiced. I then became enamored with the tech & creative possibilities that an onchain era poses.</p>
    <p>Having collected bored apes, cool cats, cryptoadz, pixel vault, gutter cats, alien boys, art blocks, and countless rugs & shitcoins in my hidden folders - I knew that the endless capital spending was a signal that something special was underneath all this.</p>
    <p>Onchain culture. A web experience that provides provenance and decentralized commerce/community at a global scale, powered by decentralized currencies that cut out nation state strong-arm tactics.</p>
    <p>My art philosophy is creative abundance. I create in the style of a professional athlete. Each day I train, and when burn out is coming I recover. I cross train in various mediums and I am constantly pushing new PRs.</p>
    <p>The blockchain is my sports arena. The collectors are my teammates. The ‘championship’ isn’t up for grabs until we have 1B daily active users in the onchain art market - but we “stay ready so we don’t have to get ready.”</p>
