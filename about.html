    <p>An informalist that somehow keeps getting better at it.</p>
    <p>My creative philosophy is more like an existential philosophy; I create my life and reflect that process into creative mediums frequently. A compulsion of sorts, but an undeniably enjoyable one.</p>
    <p>Wise mem have said that "beauty will save us." And on the surface it may seem incredibly inconsiderate to the plagues of human suffering, but as someone who has been to Hell a few times too many... I agree with them. It saved me after all.</p>
    <p>I have no clue if what I capture in time will be of value to you, and on many levels it is not my responsibility. I show up, do my best, and share it for those that it will assist. I hope that's you.</p>
